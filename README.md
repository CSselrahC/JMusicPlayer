> **optional:**
> - [x] ~~add a function for: adding music to the player~~
> - [x] ~~add a function for: up and down buttons for the music player <sub> array might work </sub>~~
> - [ ] add a function for: volume up and volume down
> - [ ] add a function for: "loop 1 music" and "loop all music"
> - [ ] add a function for: shuffle <sub> math random might work </sub>
> 
> ~~**important:**~~
> - [x] ~~up and down buttons~~
> - [x] ~~volume up and volume down buttons~~
> - [x] ~~play music button (that transforms to pause button when pressed)~~
> - [x] ~~loop 1 button~~
> - [x] ~~loop all button~~
> - [x] ~~shuffle button~~
> 
> ~~**Things to fix:**~~
> - [x] ~~when the table already have music, the selected row does not change (mainly visual problem, up and down button still works as intended)~~
> - [x] ~~table should not be editable~~
> - [x] ~~table does not update immediately when you add a music (the table does update when you scroll using the scroll pane)~~
